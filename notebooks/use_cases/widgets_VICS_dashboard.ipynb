    "A common need of geoscientists is to diagnose their favorite system's behavior in space and time across multiple variables. An example is the response of the climate system to explosive volcanism, which cools climate in the years that follow a large eruption. Effects can reverberate for several years across multiple variables, and building tools to visually track this information can be dauting. Inspired by the [VICS working group](https://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/vics/intro), this notebook shows how to build widgets that allow to probe the relationship between volcanism and climate over the Common Era.  \n",

    "We don't have latitude-longitude pairs for `aod550` data, but given atmospheric mixing across latitude bands, it may be informative to plot variation in the stratospheric aerosol optical at a wavelength of 550 nm on a time-latitude grid. `pcolor`, or pseudocolor plots are useful for visualizing three dimensions of data, in 2D.  When the data has two independent variables (like latitude and time) and one dependent variable, one option is to plot it in a three axis x-y-z arrangement, but interpreting 2D renderings of 3D objects is tricky, so often it is easier to investigate data presented as a variation in color over the grid formed by, for example, time and latitude.
